The folder 'Financial' contains updated records of Bitcoin shares, and an R script of machine learning to calculate the probabilities of the 'next-minute' falling or increasing in difference between both Closed and Open stock shares. 

It's calculated via:

```
Open_Stock - Closed_stock
```

Then from these values, take the difference of the next minute relative to the last, and categorise these within ranges. Then take a machine learning model of time, open and closed stocks, to understand what's the probability of various ranges falling into one of these categories in the next minute.
