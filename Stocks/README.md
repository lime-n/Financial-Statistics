# Stocks
**Stocks** is a python script that extract data output from an executable programme. It safely stores these into multiple files, and each files is then read back into python at a 10 second lag. Therefore, whilst one file has data saved into it, the previous file is being read into python and cleaned.

**sql_export_insert_data** is a python script that provides an example of how to upload the stored results into an sql database by creating a table, and inserting the data into that table.
